Producer side: In your producer code, you're creating a client and producer that connect to a Pulsar server 
running on your local machine (at pulsar://localhost:6650). You're opening a file (in this case New York_0.json), 
reading its contents as JSON data, and sending it to the 'my_topic' topic on the Pulsar server. After sending the data, 
you're properly closing the producer and the client.


Consumer side: Similarly, you're creating a client and consumer that also connect to the Pulsar server. The consumer 
subscribes to the 'my_topic' topic and begins listening for new messages. When a new message arrives 
(the JSON data you sent from the producer), the consumer receives the message, prints its data and id, 
and then acknowledges the message to the Pulsar server. The acknowledgement tells the server that the message was 
successfully processed and doesn't need to be redelivered. If any error occurs during this process, 
the consumer negatively acknowledges the message to the server, causing the server to redeliver the message at a later time.
